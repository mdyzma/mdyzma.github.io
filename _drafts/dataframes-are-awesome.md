What language, which program to chose for data science? Which one is better? Python? R? Maybe Julia? Which should I use? All have advantages and weaknesses. Python is more general programming language, R has strong community support in math and statistics. Julia is strongly typed, uber fast...

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  print("Hi, {0}".format(name))

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
