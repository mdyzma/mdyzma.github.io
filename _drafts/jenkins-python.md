Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software. Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with the Java Runtime Environment installed.


### Jenkins
https://jenkins.io

Unlike compiled languages, Python doesnâ€™t need a "build" per se. Python projects can still benefit greatly from using Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery.

In the Python ecosystem there are tools which can be integrated into Jenkins for testing/reporting such as:

nose2 for executing unit tests and generating JUnit-compatible XML test reports and Cobertura-compatible code coverage reports.
