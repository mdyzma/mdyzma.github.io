## Swarm mission

SWARM mission is one of the most interesting in 


## Data exchange

## Data storage




You have psace data and they are treated using space technology. Reality is quite opposite.  Some of them are  Raw data are sent to Earth to the Processing Data Centers. For example European Space Agency uses two Their value result not only form models used to calculat


ow to deal with big data using python. Does python scale out and scale up? What is PySpark and how to use it with HDFS data warehouses.
