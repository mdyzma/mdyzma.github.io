Use of matplotlib and baseplot libraries to create interactive dashboard displaying positions of three Swarm satellites studying Earth's magnetosphere as a part of ESA Earth Explorers mission.


## ESA SWARM mission

Swarm is part of Earth Explorer missions realized by European Space Agency (ESA). Trio of satellites were launched in October 2014 from Kazachstan.

The primary goal of the Swarm mission is to provide detailed map of Earth's  magnetic field and its global dynamics in time. _"The Swarm mission aims to help us understand the external and internal processes that contribute to the Earth's magnetic fields, as well as allowing for new and exciting studies of the lithospheric field."_ (from [ESA SWARM web page][swarm])
