Story and experience
====================

I'm Michal Dyzma and I like to consider myself a data scientist. Science is my passion. I graduated University of Lodz holding two M.Sc in my hands: one in **Genetics** and one in **Neurobiology**. I was fascinated how brain and basic blocks of our structure can influence each other. 

Experimental research
---------------------
After graduation I began very humbly as a Lab technician in Occupational Medicine Institute, conducting behavioral and lab experiments for large EU project **Devnertox**. 

In 2006 I was granted Marie Curie Fellowship and left Poland to do experimental work in very prestigious and very interesting topic - Effects of sleep restriction on human health. Project was realized in Andre Vesale Hospital near Brussels. In Vesale I was amazed by possibilities of the software classifying human brain waives. It was my first, but not last, contact with Matlab.

Theoretical research
--------------------
After spending some time working on experimental side of the field (Devnertox, Sleep) I decided to do theoretical stuff. In 2009 I enrolled to PhD program in Polish Academy of Sciences at the Institute of Fundamental Technological Research. At Department of Mechanics and Physics of Fluids, Laboratory of Modeling in Biology and Medicine I devoted my time to research mathematical modeling of biological processes. As a result, in 2016, I defended PhD thesis, which expanded currently used models of the calcium dynamics in the eukaryotic cells. Adding micro-domains to the equation and tracing calcium concentration in different cell compartments I could recreate initial steps of apoptosis. A process leading to the controlled cells death. Numerical analysis of the model was done in Matlab. [**PhD Thesis (in Polish)**][phd-thesis]. 

After my adventure with mathematical modeling I started to develop "real software". I have done some  protein-RNA docking during my post-doc training in one of the best labs in Europe [**IIMCB Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Protein Engineering**][bujnicki-lab] in Warsaw. Over there I got familiar with python and theoretical research on nucleic acids and proteins. 

Corporate experience
--------------------

In 2015, [**GMV Aerospace**][gmv] hired me and I had the chance to work in very exciting and promising field - space projects. I maintained and developed software for ESA data processing centers.

I'm currently living in Warsaw, Poland and working in [**GMV Aerospace**][gmv], developing software responsible for data processing from several satellites launched as a part of Living Planet Program. It is a European Space Agency initiative dedicated to observe Earth from space and provide research data about Earth's atmosphere, magnetic field, photosynthesis and many more aspects of the planet's status. Please visit [**Living Planet**][living-planet] for details.

Here I am. Scientific background, author of many peer reviewed papers on biology, mathematical modeling and bioinformatics combined with corporate, large software house, experience in one. 

From time to time I write stuff on [Twitter][tw] and throw some code on [GitHub][gh].

**Enjoy!**
