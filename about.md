Story and experience
====================

I'm Michal Dyzma and I like to consider myslef a data scientist. Science is my passion. I graduated University of Lodz holding two M.Sc in my hand one in **Genetics** and one in **Neurobiology**. I was facinated how brain and basic blocks of our structure can influence each other. 

Experimental research
---------------------
After graduation I began very humbly as a Lab technitian in Occupational Medicine Institute. Conducting behavioral and lab experiments for large EU project **Devnertox**. In 2006 I was granted Marie Curie Felowship and left Poland to do experimental work in very prestigious and very inteeresting topic - Effects of sleep restriction on human health. Project was realised in Andre Vesale Hospital near Brussels. In Vesale I was amazed by posibilities of the software clasifying human brain waives. It was my first, but not last contact with Matlab.

Theoretical research
--------------------
After spending some time working on experimental side of the field (Devnertox, Sleep) I decided to go theoretical. As a result I defended PhD thesis in 2016, which expanded currently used mathematical models of the calcium dynamics in the eukaryotic cells. Adding microdomains to the equation and tracing calcium concentration in different cell compartments I was able to recreate initial steps of apoptosis, which is a process leading to the cells death. Numerical analysis of the model was done in Matlab. [**PhD Thesis (in Polish)**][phd-thesis]. 

After my advanture with mathematical modelling I started to develop "real software". I have done some  protein-RNA docking during my post-doc training in one of the best labs in Europe [**IIMCB Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Protein Engineering**][bujnicki-lab] in Warsaw. Over there I got familiar with python and theoretical research on nucleic acids and proteins. 

Corporate experience
--------------------

In 2015, [**GMV Aerospace**][gmv] hired me and I had the chance to work in very exciting and promising field - space projects. I maintained and developed software for ESA data processing centers.

I'm currently living in Warsaw, Poland and working in [**GMV Aerospace**][gmv], developing softwre responsible for data processing from several satelites launched as a part of Living Planet Programm, a Euoropean Space Agency initiative dedicated to observe Earth from space and provide research data about Earth's atmosphere, magnetic field and photosythesis on the surface of the planet. Please visit [**Living Planet**][living-planet] for details.

Here I am. Scientific background, author of many peer reviewed papers on biology, mathematical mmodels and bioinformatics with corporate, large software house, experience in one. 

From time to time I write stuff on [Twitter][tw] and throw some code on [GitHub][gh].

**Enjoy!**
