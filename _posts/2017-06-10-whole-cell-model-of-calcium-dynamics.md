Calcium is very important for everyday cell functioning. It is a signaling molecule, which is involved in nearly every aspect of the life. It coordinates spectrum of cellular responses, including very well known like muscle contraction,  to some mysterious, but equally important, like apoptosis or G-potein signaling pathways. It also acts on the most basic level of life, molecular level. Its tracking in real time is very hard and sometimes impossible. Hence mathematical models, which try to explain parts impossible to explain with "normal experiment". I will explain specific model of calcium dynamics in cells with nucleus (eukaryotic), which I created during my PhD. Numerical analysis was done in Matlab. Unfortunately I do not have access to this Package anymore, therefore I will implement and perform all numerical analysis in Python.
