Goal
----
Create environment where different Jupyter kernels are available and data may be passed between them. Kernels chosen for demonstration: Python 2, Python 3, R and Julia.

Rationale
---------
Which language, program to chose for data science? Which is better? Python? R? Maybe young Julia? Which should I use? All have advantages and weaknesses. Python is more general programming language, R has strong community support in doing statistics, math in general. Julia is strongly typed, uber fast...

This question often appears in discussions and conferences. 

There is no good answer to this questions. If you want do big things use all tools available. Use best tools possible.

If you struggle between using python or R, don't bother any more... Why not use both?! At the same time in the same notebook, passing data between languages. With Jupyter notebook it is all possible.

Let's do it
-----------






Whenever I am reading some data science related groups on reddit, quora or wykop (Polish site) i can often see 



{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  print("Hi, {0}".format(name))

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
